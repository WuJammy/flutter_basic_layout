# Flutter Basic Layout Sample

 ## **( 1 )  About**
 This simple example is a Flutter App with AppBar. You can see its detail in my [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppHAFJktlJk&t=2212s&ab_channel=%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E4%BA%82%E8%81%8A).  
 
 ## **( 2 )  AppBar Introduction**
 An app bar consists of a toolbar and potentially other widgets.
 * leading : Typically the leading widget is an Icon or an IconButton. It displays before the toolbar's title.
 * title : Typically a Text widget that contains a description of the current contents of the app.
 * action : A list of Widgets to display in a row after the title widget.
